  <!-- PAGE INTRO -->
  <section>
    <h1>Our Journey</h1>
    <p>
      NeuroNest is not just a technical project — it is a response to a real,
      deeply human problem that many families face silently.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY IT STARTED -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why NeuroNest Started</h2>
    <p>
      We observed a significant gap between early developmental concerns
      and access to clear, reliable guidance for families.
      Many caregivers struggle with uncertainty, misinformation,
      and delayed support.
    </p>
    <p>
      NeuroNest began as an effort to bridge this gap responsibly —
      by prioritizing awareness, empathy, and ethical technology.
    </p>

  <!-- CHALLENGES -->
  <section class="journey-block highlight">
  <h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Limited awareness around early developmental differences often leads to
      confusion, hesitation, or delayed conversations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Social stigma and fear of labels can discourage families from seeking
      information at an early stage.
    </li>
    <li>
      Misinformation and oversimplified online content can create unnecessary
      anxiety or false confidence.
    </li>
    <li>
      Balancing the use of technology while respecting the need for human and
      clinical judgment in sensitive domains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designing a tool that informs without overwhelming, and supports without
      directing.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


  <!-- LEARNINGS -->
  <section>
    <h2>What We’ve Learned</h2>
    <p>
      One of our biggest learnings was that technology alone is not the solution.
      True impact comes from combining ethical design, clinical insight,
      and human-centered thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI should support decision-making — not replace professionals
      or oversimplify complex realities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Vision Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      Our long-term vision is to evolve NeuroNest into a trusted support ecosystem
      that connects families, clinicians, educators, and researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to responsibly expand our AI capabilities while maintaining
      transparency, safety, and inclusivity at every step.
    </p>
