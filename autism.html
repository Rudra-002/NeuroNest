    <h1>Autism Awareness & Understanding</h1>
    <p>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects
      how individuals communicate, interact socially, and perceive the world.
      It is not an illness — it is a different way of experiencing life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT IS AUTISM -->
  <section>
    <h2>What Is Autism?</h2>
    <p>
      Autism is called a “spectrum” because it affects people in different ways
      and to different degrees. Some individuals may require significant support,
      while others may live independently with minimal assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autism is lifelong, but with the right support and understanding, individuals
      on the spectrum can thrive.
    </p>

  <!-- EFFECT ON CHILDREN -->
  <section>
    <h2>How Autism Affects Children</h2>
    <p>
      Children with autism may experience differences in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Communication and language development</li>
      <li>Social interaction and eye contact</li>
      <li>Sensory sensitivity (sound, light, touch)</li>
      <li>Behavioral patterns and routines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These differences are not weaknesses — they are variations of human development.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EFFECT ON FAMILIES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Impact on Families & Caregivers</h2>
    <p>
      Families and caregivers often face emotional, social, and financial challenges.
      Lack of awareness, delayed identification, and social stigma can increase stress
      and isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early awareness and access to reliable information can significantly reduce
      uncertainty and help families make informed decisions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MYTHS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Common Myths & Misconceptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ Autism is caused by poor parenting</li>
      <li>❌ All autistic individuals have the same abilities</li>
      <li>❌ Autism cannot improve with support</li>
      <li>❌ Autism means lack of intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These myths contribute to stigma and delay meaningful support.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY EARLY AWARENESS -->
  <section>
  <h2>Why Early Awareness Matters</h2>

  <h3 style="margin-top:15px; color:#0b3c5d;">
    Understanding early signs helps families act with clarity, not fear
  </h3>

  <p>
    Early awareness does not mean rushing to conclusions or labels.
    It simply means being informed and observant during a child’s
    developmental years.
  </p>

  <p>
    When early signs are overlooked or misunderstood, families may
    experience delayed access to guidance, resources, and supportive
    interventions that could otherwise make everyday life easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recognizing patterns early allows caregivers to seek the right
    information, ask better questions, and make thoughtful decisions
    — without panic or pressure.
